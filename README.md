# My First Website 🌐

This is the first website I've ever built and published online. This marks the start of my public coding journey.

## What This Is
- A simple HTML page with basic CSS styling.
- My first commit on GitHub.
- My first step towards becoming a developer.

## The Mindset
> "I'm not afraid of ugly code. I'm afraid of not starting."

*This is only the beginning.*
